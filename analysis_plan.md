# First analysis plan

This is the suggested analysis plan for the outlier detection.

## Reading we need to do

* Look at Nipy's diagnostics (put in link here).
* Review Principal Component Analysis (where?).
* Review FSL's ICA method.

## Action plan

* Use simplest possible outlier detection to get `find_outlier.py` to work.
* Review methods above and try variants.
* Review after course lessons on:
    * Statistical detection of activation
    * Motion detection
