# Analysis plan

Plan for building outlier detection.

## Reading

Read about other outlier detection methods.

* Consider Nipy detection methods
* Consider Principal Component Analysis
* Review FSL ICA methods (though complicated)
* Do literature search for DVARS (also in Nipy)

## Plan

* Write initial simple detector
* Review graphically
* Refine with more information on:
    * Statistical modeling
    * Motion correction
